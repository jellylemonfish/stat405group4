The small.tar is a 93.9 MB subset of the original 100GB data set that I got from Kaggle for coding testing.
The way to upload all the data sets to HPC/CHTC needs to be discussed, or ask professor or staffs.

to read those .pickle documents smoothly, start R buffer in emacs and run 
install.packages('reticulate')
These are just some actions similar to what we did with the .fit documents in HW2. Then it should work.
